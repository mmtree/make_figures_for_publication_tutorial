# Tutorial 1 &ndash; basics

This tutorial chronicles the step-by-step construction of the template figure seen below. We start by generating data and subfigures in Matlab (or Python) then compose subfigures and add annotations in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) and end with a single pdf (or .eps, .png, other prefered format ...) of the entire panel (a, b, c) which can be easily inserted into a latex document.

This tutorial covers the following...

1. How to standarize fonts and font sizes across figures and subfigures.

2. How to use colors from a Matlab color palette

3. How to compose a panel of individual figures in Inkscape.

4. How to add text and math latex annotations to a panel in Inkscape.

5. How to align and space all content in a panel.

6. How to save figure content as an appropriate file size.


This tutorial uses the following programs

1. [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (or [Python](https://www.python.org/))

2. [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)

3. [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/)

## Step 1 &ndash; Create subfigure in Matlab

Run the script

  demo_make_figs.m
  
which creates subfigures 
  demo_fig1.pdf
  demo_fig2.pdf
